The task is to analyze data from an independent gaming company's most recent fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
